Homework 1 - Deep Learning Class

part 1 - Blackbox Deep Learning using Fast AI colab https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb
Write Colab for illustrating use of SOTA(state of the art) model architectures of fast ai using 
1. cnn_learner for image classification
2. unet_learner for segmentation, 
3. text_classifier_learner for sentiment analysis
4. tabular-learner for decision tree
5. collab_learner for ranking

part 2 - Whitebox Deep Learning read and perform the codelab https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist#0
